Welcome to the openSX70 website!
This intends to be your home for all things SX70 and the home of all sorts of modifications and hacks on the SX70, but more specifically the home of the openSX70 project.

It doesn't have to be all technical mumbo-jumbo, you can post about your new skin, your new accessory or how you use your camera to take better pictures...
What is allowed/not allowed in the group?
Of course we don't want spam, but we welcome ads and news about products if they mean an improvement on the SX70, say a new skin, a modification on a camera, an accessory vintage or new for the camera.
We welcome input from our members. Anything constructive is appreciated.
You can post your with/of SX70 photos if they have relation with a hack, mod or improvement, or made by a special camera, say with manual option.
On my part I wish that people with different skills collaborate to improve our projects.
I want to mention a few projects that I have in mind, the openSX70 camera (also setting up the openSX70.com page), the SX70-600 film conversions, and switches, making/reproducing old tools at affordable prices for members, creating improving the original repair manuals...
But I want to make clear two things: it is not at all about my personal projects, and that we support and admire all similar commercial or non-commercial  projects. We feel that what is good for the SX70 is good for all of us, so please share.
If you think you can help, please post, if you have a hack or a tip, please post, if you know how to repair a certain fault, please post.
Please note that I am not an SX70 repairman and probably don't know how to fix your camera aside from the obvious, I am neither a programmer nor know much of electronics aside from the basic stuff. But I definitely try.
So please, please, share your projects and contribute with your skills. And remember:
It is not what your Polaroid can do for you as for what YOU can do for your Polaroid!
