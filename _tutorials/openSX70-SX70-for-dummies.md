<!-- # OPEN SX70-ARDUINO FOR DUMMIES**: Part two, SX70 the "Clockwork electronics" worder -->

## Introduction

The object of this (so-called) tutorial is to give you some basic insight on how *I UNDERSTAND* the camera works. I say it is mechanical electronics, better we could call it "clockwork" electronics.

I want to make something quite clear: all SX70 cameras control is NOT DIGITAL, in the modern sense of the word. But that does not mean that it doesn't use logic and gates: it does.

The camera consists on a bunch of gears that move the mirror up and down, and push the film outward throught the rollers, two solenoids, and 9 switches S1 through S9.
