+ ## [**main arduino project**](https://github.com/openSX70/openSX70-Arduino-main "go to files")

This is the main [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) code, and then some tests. I have the Arduino code in several tabs to ease readability. Also most of the stuff is in functions to make loop more readable. This is **NOT WORKING NOW** as is still a work in progress.

+ ## [**Eagle PCB and schematic for the main SX70 board**](https://github.com/openSX70/openSX70-PCB "go to files")

This is the [EagleCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download "EagleCAD free download") files for the main PCB design. For non commercial use. **UNTESTED.**

+ ## [**Eagle PCB and schematic for the "Dongle" SX70 board**](https://github.com/openSX70/openSX70-dongle-PCB "go to files")

This is the [EagleCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download "EagleCAD free download") files for the control Dongle PCB design. For non commercial use. You connect the dongle through the flash connector. **ONLY WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE [MAIN PCB BOARD](https://github.com/openSX70/openSX70-PCB)** of the openSX70 project. **UNTESTED.**


+ ## [**Eagle PCB and schematic for the Flash tester board**](https://github.com/openSX70/SX70_Flash_Tester "go to files")

This is the [EagleCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download "EagleCAD free download") files for the "Flash Tester" as described in the "Repair Manual", it works with **ANY** SX70 or Sonar camera that has the flash slot connector. Two versions: through hole and "mini" SMD version. openSX70 branded. **UNTESTED.**


+ ## [**Eagle PCB and schematic for the PC Flash adapter board**](https://github.com/openSX70/SX70-PC-Flash "go to files")

This is the [EagleCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download "EagleCAD free download") files for the adapter from SX70 slot flash connector, it works with **ANY** SX70 or Sonar camera that has the flash slot connector. It is a version a bit different simpler that what is already on the web. **UNTESTED.**

+ ## [**Eagle PCB openSX70 custom library**](https://github.com/openSX70/Eagle-library "go to files")

This is the [EagleCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download "EagleCAD free download") library with custom designed components and connectors some more specific than others to the project. **UNTESTED.**
