##What is openSX70?
It is many things at once, but, in a nutshell, openSX70 is an open source (hardware and software) project that aims to take the SX70 beyond what is possible now in a cheap and non destructive way. 

##Its main project at the moment is to make an Arduino-based replacement PCB (ECM in Polaroid lingo, and corresponding Arduino code to gain manual camera control, allow for double exposures, Bluetooth control and much more.
At the same time the project aims to be a hub of all things SX70 related, with documents concerning tips, repairs or hacks, like the electronic modification of your camera to accept 600-ISO film. There are other web pages about the SX70, but most seem to be abandoned. We would like to compile as many as possible resources.

##Where is openSX70?
Our webpage www.opensx70.com. We also have Facebook group. We are also on instagram and Twitter. The code and files are in Github.

But, hasn’t this already been done?
Yes… and no. There are at least two awesome commercial projects that accomplish something quite similar. But this is the first open source project.

So openSX70 is a product?
Again, yes and no, since it is an open project anyone will be able to make his own pcb (as long as it has no commercial purpose).
Since we recognize that disassembling the SX70 and replacing the board is not for the faint of heart, we intent to set up a network of associates that will do it for you. That will help us gain economies of scale, and, cover operating cost. Once the pcb is in the camera you will be able to reprogram it as many times as you want.


Ok, I like it, where can I get one?
Please bear in mind that openSX70 is not a product, and will probably never be as such. Think of it as an ever improving experimental platform. As an open project, it is basically free as long as you use for non commercial purposes under Creative Commons "Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)" https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/

So then… where are you now?
We are quite ahead in development. We have successfully replaced the ECM of an alpha camera with an external prototype board: the“FrankenSX70”. Now we have the


We are also trying to replicate and make more affordable some of the special tools needed to open and fix the SX70, and find replacements and alternatives of critical parts.

We need help: join us!
We want you to join us on the openSX70 project in any capacity that you wish, we need your help, we have to set up the openSX70 portal, we need arduino and microcontroller programmers, we need help designing the PCB, and above all, we need enthusiasts to join and propagate the project!

We want to encourage and support for similar commercial products and services and specially the dedicated people that repair these amazing cameras. All for the love of the SX70.

If you have a skill, or maybe a repair manual, a tool, a picture of a tool, and, in general anything that might be of interest  related to the original Polaroid/SX70, and are willing to help please contact us, if you want to keep it confidential. We will honor your wishes. You can also contact the openSX70 group on Facebook (and eventually the webpage).
