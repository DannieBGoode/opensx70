Now that I feel a bit more confident on the project I am trying to spread the word on the openSX70 project:

I am slowly sending emails to websites and people that I feel might be interested, and I started with Supersense, the brainchild of Doc in Vienna, the place for all things analog. And I got featured in their newsletter, which is nice. I am also sending "kits" to assemble openSX70 cameras. I sent one to Supersense and two more kits. And I hope to send a few more once I have more uDongles and FTDIs.

In the middle of all this I was lucky enough to be introduced to Marco of AnalogThings. He makes awesome videos, many of them instant-photography related. He is now "building" community through Discord, I invite you all to subscribe to his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_1Wc6fdIxr3wctK2bDTLkw) and to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/446176201552298028/451810250971152384""openSX70")..

I have also sent a kit to him and hope he makes a video of the camera modification and of the camera results. Thank you Marco!!

I have also sent prototype#3.5 to a photographer and hope he takes pictures with the camera soon. We will see... I hope I had more means and more cameras to send and "spread the word"
