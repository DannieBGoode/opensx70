One day ahead of the scheduled date the new boards from JLCPCB have landed.
Of course I have to test them.

The new "Aladdin-FPC" blue boards look stunning. I only hope they work!

I have also done a custom adapter to be able to program the bootloader into the arduino with the minipro programmer.

This is a breakout board for the FPC cable.

This is the full FTDI board...

Unfortunately I see that I ordered "Aladdin" (green, NON-FPC) wrong! 1.6mm instead of the required .6mm. D'HO!

Now I hope to be able to to hand-make a prototype, and hopefully the first openSX70 camera!
