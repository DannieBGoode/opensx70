As part of my on going investigation on the SX70 I wanted to photograph the shutter operation: I wanted to know how log it takes for the shutter to open from the moment I remove the power to the Solenoid.
It turns out it is a lot.
For this purpose I got the amazing RX100 and built a jig to do my tests.

It is basically a few pieces of MDF wood screwed toguether. I have a sliding platform for the digital camera and a close up lens.

Then I process the video with Avisynth and extract a bunch of jpegs with the frame number, every frame is a ms. 
I have modified my arduino code to light an LED for 5ms just before and after I issue the shutter open and shutter close command. When the LED turns off, it is T=-1.

Then at T=8 the shutter begins to let light through, this is very consistent with both the Sonar and the SLR690.

At T=49 we can say that the shutter is at f.8.

At T=70 the LED lights again and the Solenoid is energized.

And finally at T=82 the shutter is totally closed.

So we can say that it takes around 48-50ms to fully open and 10-15 to close, so it definitely closes much faster that when it opens with the spring action. I have no tried to make it faster by adjusting the screw.

As a conclusion, I am happy with the results. I have made a even-slower-motion video of the whole thing for my Alpha ("Franken") camera. 66ms lends to the shutter to archieve the f.8 fully open possition. 
I am baffled as to the relation of the aperture with the speed, meaning, when is a shot x ms f.8? When it reaches f.8 in x ms of time or when it, once it has reached f.8 position stays in that position for x ms amount of time?

I might be redoing the whole thing, trying to get more accurate across-the-board results. 
My first-gen camera didn't work as the rest. I am thinking that maybe it lacks the flyback protection diode?
Keep learning!
