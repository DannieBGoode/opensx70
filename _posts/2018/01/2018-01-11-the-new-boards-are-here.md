I have new boards! Both the main camera PCB and an new dongle board.

The new version of the main PCB version 3.4.1 nicknamed "chocolate" is color red and looks amazing. I am starting to do tests with it an I am hopeful it will work.

I have ordered it .6mm and has some major changes, like the fact that the Atmega328P is in a 45º angle, the FTDI (programming port) is offset and all the tracks (specially the power ones) are much much wider.

I also have a new totally working dongle. Has a 16-position rotary selector switch, two switches for options, an LED and a PC (jack) connector.

Here is the "evolution" from an original PCB.

I hope I can iron out all the troubles that might encounter with "chocolate" and have soon my first working openSX70!!!
