Finally got the time to start testing Aladdin. 

Soldering the FPC is **A ROYAL PAIN** I could do it (sort of) on my second trial. But then I couldn't solder the light meter cheap.
The conclusion is that .5mm pitch SMD electronic components are not at a human scale.

My adapter to program to the Atmega with the custom 2.8V/8Mhz bootloader was a total success. 
That is needed because the Minipro programmer only supports the 28-pin DIP Atmegas328p, and my adapter was a TQFP "universal" pin-to-pin adapter.
So I made a board to map the 32-pin Atmega to the 28-pin DIP Atmega.

As always I started by testing by uploading Blink, and, after double-checking the FPC connector it loaded and worked!!

Here is the complete board with the cable, and the FTDI.

When I build the openSX70, while testing and debugging the software the FPC will show through the camera, so I can easily connect the FTDI and upload some new software.

Finally I have been able to re-work the dongle to include the regulator to bring the power down to 2.8V as previously reported. It is not nice, but I hope it works!

I hope tomorrow I can do much more software and hardware tests.
