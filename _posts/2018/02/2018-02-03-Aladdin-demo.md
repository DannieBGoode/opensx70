{% include video id="MU2MqRjvjZs" provider="youtube" class="full"%}
I have added captions explaining what I do on the video!
Basically all works. I cannot test the light meter because I couldn't solder the damned chip! 
Will try to make a few other prototypes and hopefully a camera next week.

I need broken cameras to build prototypes!! Please contact me for donations: opensx70 at opensx70 dot com.

I also want to mention that a Facebook group member has contacted me to make a 3D printed enclosure to for the dongle!!! 
It will probably a different physical design to be more enclosure-friendly.

Than you for the support!
