(external flash WITHOUT solenoid#2 engaged, full f.8 aperture, no distance compensation)

Testing flash operation for the first time with the OpenSX70 camera.

First shot with the MiNT flash, second shot with an external strobe connected to the dongle. The usual follow focus aperture engaging solenoid #2.

Finally the third shot was taken at full aperture, that is without engaging solenoid #2. This is accomplished through software, with no hardware modification. So this picture looks exactly the way I intended. I guess there can be a set up where this possibility might be useful.

Will try to make a video tomorrow.
