Santa has been really nice with the openSX70 lab, we got a new [JBC soldering and desoldering station](https://www.jbctools.com/ddse-2-tools-rework-station-with-electric-pump-product-939-category-999.html) that is really really nice. Thank you Santa! We also got "pass-down" a really nice lab power supply. But it is lonely at the openSX70lab.

So since I have a few spare boards, I have decided to start a sort of beta program!

![Fire image]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/2018/12/2018-12-30-beta-program-1.jpg)

I am very happy with the result of the [giveaway](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/11/giveaway). [Pieter](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/12/winner) and his brother Jan are working really hard to make their openSX70 camera work.

I am looking for people interested in the project, but I also want to set a few requisites:

 * You must have a suitable camera (alpha, alpha model 2) Sonars or earlier models are NOT suitable, please don't ask. It has to be in fully working condition.

 * You don't necesarily need to have the soldering skills but only be commited to install it through whatever means (your, friend, a repair shop, whatever) nevertheless it is of course better if you have the skills.

 * You are expected to be able to [upload new software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6CblpqR6lJp2c8rYj9HKU2SYuAUMXcZzxQYi2WTeYM) through the [arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). That does not mean that you necesarily know how to code in Arduino, but that would be a big plus.

 * Finally and also very important, you need to have the reasonable amount of time to dedicate to the project, and also film to (probably) literally waste.

 * It will considered a plus if have wizzards/strobes and of course phototography experience (but I guess we can take that for granted!)


 * You will get, the "kit" (screwdriver optional, only if you need it) and access to a beta-testers-users forum (that I have to set up) to share information.

I want to find out mainly:

consistency across cameras, specially in shutter operation, exposure values, 
user interface feedback
what features you fancy the most...

If you already have an openSX70 please also "join" the program. I think we can do the most amazing SX70 camera ever (and if we don't we'll at least have a lot of fun in the process!)

If you want to join and have the "qualifications" please join the [mailchimp list](https://opensx70.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=806a32d4f5ebbeef65c4a0661&id=92126a4933) and place a comment down below with your qualifications. If I see that any of the candidates can help with the new PCBs calibrating the light meter, I might even send a kit with one of those!

Please read the previous posts and the GOOGLE docs:

[camera operation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TnC51uTfky0JhySty0oG02JZn2nBN-3xTkvg4KMKXlw)

[board installation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rmLisqLQVZw1geXh8mKx_AVkoZlMeiPiUtI20Hwy-E)

[software upgrade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6CblpqR6lJp2c8rYj9HKU2SYuAUMXcZzxQYi2WTeYM)

And happy new year 2019 to all!!!
