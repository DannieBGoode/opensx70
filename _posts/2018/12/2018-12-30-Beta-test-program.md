Santa has been really nice with the openSX70 lab, we got a new JBC soldering and desoldering station that is really really nice. Thank you Santa! We also got "pass-down" a really nice lab power supply. But it is really lonely at the openSX70lab.

So since I have a few spare boards, I have decided to start a sort of beta program!

![Fire image]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/2018/12/2018-12-30-beta-program-1.jpg)

I am very happy with the result of the [giveaway](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/11/giveaway). [Pieter](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/12/winner) and his brother Jan are working really hard to make their openSX70 camera work.

I am looking for people interested in the project, but I also want to set a few requisites:

 * You must have a suitable camera (alpha, alpha model 2) Sonars or earlier models are NOT suitable, please don't ask. It has to be in fully working condition.

 * You don't necesarily need to have the soldering skills but only be commited to install it through whatever means (your, friend, a repair shop, whatever) nevertheless it is of course better if you have the skills.

 * You are expected to be able to upload new software through the arduino IDE. That does not mean that you necesarily know how to program in Arduino, but that would be a big plus.

 * Finally and also very important, you need to have the reasonable amount of time to devout to the project, and also film to (probably) literally waste.

 * It will considered a plus if have wizzards/strobes and of course phototography experience (but I guess we can take that for granted!)


 * You will get, the "kit" (screwdriver optional, only if you need it) and access to a beta-testers-users forum (that I have to set up) to share information.

I want to find out mainly:

consistency across cameras, specially in shutter operation, exposure values, 
user interface feedback
what features you fancy the most
...

If you already have an openSX70 please also "join" the program. I think we can do the most amazing SX70 camera ever (and if we don't we'll at least have a lot of fun in the process!)

If you want to join and have the qualifications please join the [mailchimp list](https://opensx70.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=806a32d4f5ebbeef65c4a0661&id=92126a4933) and place a comment down below with your qualifications. If I see that any of the candidates can help with the new PCBs calibrating the light meter, I might even send a kit with one of those!

And happy new year 2019 to all!!!
