Santa has been really nice with the openSX70 lab, we got a new [JBC soldering and desoldering station](https://www.jbctools.com/ddse-2-tools-rework-station-with-electric-pump-product-939-category-999.html) that is really really nice. Thank you Santa! We also got "pass-down" a really nice lab power supply. But it is lonely at the openSX70lab.

And since I have a few spare boards, I have decided to start a sort of beta program!

![Fire image]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/2018/12/2018-12-30-beta-program-2.jpg)

I am very happy with the results of the previous [giveaway](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/11/giveaway). [Pieter](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/12/winner) and his brother Jan are working really hard to make their openSX70 camera work.

I am looking for people interested in the project, but I also want to set a few requisites:

 * You must have a suitable camera (alpha, alpha model 2) Sonars or earlier models are NOT suitable, please don't ask. It has to be in fully working condition.

 * You don't necesarily need to have the soldering skills but only be commited to install it through whatever means (your, friend, a repair shop, whatever) nevertheless it is of course better if you have the skills.

 * You are expected to be able to [upload new software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6CblpqR6lJp2c8rYj9HKU2SYuAUMXcZzxQYi2WTeYM) through the [arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). That does not mean that you necesarily know how to code in Arduino, but that would be a big plus.

 * Finally and also very important, you need to have the reasonable amount of time to dedicate to the project, and also film to (probably) literally waste.

 * It will consider a plus if you have wizzards/strobes (to test flash/studio lights functionality) and of course phototography experience (but I guess we can take that for granted!)

 * In case you are selected you will get: the "kit" (screwdriver optional, only if you need it) and access to a beta-testers-users forum (that I have to set up) to share information.

I want to find out mainly:

 * consistency across cameras. Are some cameras/shutters faster/slower? Do some shutters need more "power" to operate?
 
 * test with time sequences and Exposure Values, different light conditions etc...

 * user interface feedback

 * features: what features you fancy the most... what stuff is useless and nobody needs that?
 
 * the selector wheel, has 16 slots, what are the better options there? EV or shutter speed at F8? B? T? ????
 
 * everything flash/strobes "front" curtain back curtain? shutter speed???
 
 * ?????????

If you already have an openSX70 please also "join" the program. I think that toguether we can do the most amazing SX70 camera ever (and if we don't we'll at least have a lot of fun in the process!)

If you want to join and have the "qualifications" please join the [mailchimp list](https://opensx70.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=806a32d4f5ebbeef65c4a0661&id=92126a4933) and place a comment down below with the reasons why you want to join the beta program. 

If I see that any of the candidates can help with the new PCBs calibrating the light meter, I might even send a kit with one of those! If I see many people that I find matches what I need I will try to hand build a few more PCBs.

Please read ALL the previous posts and the GOOGLE docs:

And remember I post stuff now mainly [here](https://opensx70.com/) (I only announce on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/opensx70/?hl=en) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensx70/)

Oh, and happy new year 2019 to all, 2019 it's going to be openSX70 year!!!
