You might have seen some of my posts about the **LED**. 

In the beginning the LED was more a part of the Arduino for me. It is very practical to check basic functionality of it with the Blink sketch. So if you can load a sketch (that is the software running on the Arduino) the equivalent to the *Hello World* routine is a program that makes an LED blink.
(Blink video here)
But the LED on the main PCB was in the bottom (the back so to speak) and it could not be seen. So I moved the LED to the front. But it still remained hidden on the working camera so it was still utilitarian: not very practical.

But if you have ever used a sonar camera you know that there is a little red light in the viewfinder that tells you when there isn’t enough light to take a picture. When I noticed that I was blown away.

So it clicked one day in my brain: Why not use a similar location for the LED so it would (at least theoretically) to have an LED visible in the VF?

That could be accomplished by having a donor sonar camera VF mounted on a non-sonar camera, or perhaps 3D printing the part (it is like a prism) needed to accomplish this.




(Sonar LED) 

So I did a rather rough test and it seemed to work. Of course it won’t be really tested up until I receive the boards and do a true test. It has many probabilities of failure, first on the sonar the LED is in another pcb showing from behind, and perhaps the location is critical.

What I have done is a rough estimate of the location, and of course using an SMD very small bi-color component.



I thought that it could be used to relay all sort of information and not only low light situations.

So... will it work? Wish me luck!
