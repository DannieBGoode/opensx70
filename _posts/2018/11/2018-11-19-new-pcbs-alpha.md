**STATUS:** 20181130:I have tested and "blinks" in two colours. Have to test "camera operation" but I am quite sure it will work. 
LED footprint is wrong and I have fixed it for the next batch. Still I can solder with difficulty and make it work. Already fixed it for the next batch 6.2.4 Alpha. The "gold" [ENIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroless_nickel_immersion_gold) finish is nice and easy to solder. Not sure it is worth the 5X price increase.

**COMMENTS:** 
Looks nice, LED footprint perhaps is too small or hard to hand solder. Outline fits perfectly. I wonder how hard is going to be soldering on ENIG (gold).
Photodiode footprint looks spot-on.
20181130: I have to test with a camera in the VF to see if the magic happens. Hope it does or it can be easily fix in the next batch.

**ALPHA 6.2.2**

The [HASL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_solder_leveling) finish is OK, but doesn't look as nice.

**COMMENTS:** 
Looks nice, LED footprint perhaps is too small or hard to hand solder. Outline fits perfectly. HASL looks definitely easier to solder. And way cheaper.

**uDongle v3.8 ENIG black (case friendly)**

**COST:** 28,87€ + SHIPPING + EU IMPORT DUTIES

**STATUS:** 20181130 Build one and sent it to Clément. Seems to work but I don't like it: footprint of switches (was a catch all) is not good. Holes are too small. Have to rethink it.

**COMMENTS:** 
ENIG and black but I'm not so sure about this one!
20181130: Maybe it could be smaller? Not sure. 

**uDongle v3.8 HASL green (case friendly)**

Same as before but in HASL. I'm not so sure about this one!
