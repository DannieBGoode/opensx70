There are many books and [articles](https://www.technologizer.com/2011/06/08/polaroid/) comparing the late Steve Jobs with Dr. Land, drawing parallelisms. And I understand.
It is hard now for us to [imagine Dr. Land as a showman](http://www.polaroidland.net/2013/01/27/instant-artifact-the-long-walk/), but he was. He not only was a talented scientist and entrepreneur, always insisting in the impossible. One of those persons that act as a catalyst for people around him accomplish amazing things.

An he had the stage he deserved in the Polaroid Corporation shareholder's meeting every year. 

And I had read all the stories, like fleeting an airplane to bring it full of a special kind of tulip from Holland, just because they were of the right color.

But ever since I read [this article](https://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/35071/1/Buse-P-35071-AAM.pdf) by Prof. [Peter Buse](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/arts/staff/peter-buse/), for me there was one that was legendary: the shareholder's meeting held the 23rd of April 1973. 

So I did what I always do: search online trying to find something, maybe a good scan, maybe a bad scan.

And there was **NOTHING** only [this request]http://www.polaroidland.net/2012/06/13/an-annual-report-request/ by [Christopher Bonanos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-bonanos-22651a24), the author of [Instant: The story of Polaroid](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Story-Polaroid-Christopher-Bonanos/dp/1616890851)


But I am getting ahead of myself, let me write a few quotes from [A Triumph of Genius: Edwin Land, Polaroid, and the Kodak Patent War](https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Genius-Edwin-Polaroid-Patent/dp/1627227695), Although this book is about the patent war, it has a lot of information about Polaroid. Ronald K. Fierstein is very meticulous, he talks about the unveiling of Aladdin (SX70):

*Act One of Land’s presentation was a tease. The performance occurred on April 27, 1971, when he surprised the Polaroid faithful and the assembled media at the company’s shareholders meeting with an unannounced and unofficial glimpse of the future. The event was staged in a massive, as yet unoccupied, factory Polaroid had built in the Boston suburb of Norwood to manufacture its new and mysterious camera. 

For the second act of his two-year drama, Land orchestrated a double-barreled back-to-back scenario. First, he decided to debut his new revelatory product to 3,000 Polaroid enthusiasts at the April 25, 1972, Polaroid shareholders meeting.

The 1972 shareholders meeting was held in another “cavernous” Polaroid warehouse, this time in the Boston suburb of Needham, Massachusetts. Land and his assistants had rehearsed this performance extensively over the previous weekend, and many of the props, including the film units that were to be used, were only completed at the last moment. After braving a massive traffic jam coming into the facility, and then passing through “elaborate” security measures that required them to leave their cameras at the door, the Polaroid faithful gathered with great expectation. Land was impatient for the normal business portion of the meeting to conclude so that he could start his demonstration. 

After Land’s demonstration, the attendees were able to wander among twelve octagonal platforms set up in the warehouse to watch Polaroid employees use the camera in different applications. Twelve thousand tulips had been flown in from Holland and arranged around the platforms, each housing its own scene including love ducks splashing in a pond, some children playing at a party, and a painter working at her easel.

To trumpet the retail launch of his “dream” system, Land once again orchestrated a big and dramatic event, gathering 1,200 camera dealers at the Fontainebleau Hotel in the Miami Beach on October 26, 1972. Searchlights crossed the Miami evening sky while an airplane trailed an SX-70 banner along the beach.*

I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in the Fontainebleau Hotel a long time ago, and can only imagine the spectacle. Of course then came 1973 Shareholder's meeting. By

Shareholder's meeting were *a big deal* not only for the company but for the attendees. It is difficult to find pictures of those ocasions, but I have found a [PDF by John and Mary McCann](http://www.mccannimaging.com/Retinex/Talks_files/PRAf2%20Slides%20copy.pdf). I tried to contact the McCanns to get a permit to use those pictures, but never got a reply. I highly recommend you look at it. By the way, John McCann was reponsible of the 20x24 camera. Enough said.

So the Shareholders meeting that year was going to be the first time shareholders could *play* with the SX70. Previous demostrations where highly controlled, to avoid spies from Kodak. Mr Fierstein says that in a technical demostration, at the end all pictures were punched and secured. But Kodak *spies* took the punch holes to analyse. It was war.

So you can imagine my awe, when was able to purchase one complete original report. Yes, with the rose.

It amazes me, the quality of the picture, how well colours have held. I feel fortunate to have it in my possesion. And I have scanned at high resolution.

It consists in two parts. First is *President's Letter*, it is a letter by Dr. Land addressed to the shareholders. It simulates typewriting, and Land's signature. This is the one with the rose.

Part two is the actual report. Beyond the -now- meaningless numbers, it amazes me the quality of the graphic design. It looks so modern, even today.

I hope you enjoy the report as much as I did!
