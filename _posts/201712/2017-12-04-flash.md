I have finally found the time to implement and test in the Arduino the flash operation for the opensx70. 

´´´
                  #if SHUTTER
                  shutterOPEN (); 
                  delay (51);
                  digitalWrite(FFA, HIGH);
                  delay (25);
                  analogWrite (Solenoid1,0);
                  digitalWrite(FFA, LOW);
                  delay (26);
                  shutterCLOSE();
                  #endif
 ´´´

I just roughly “translated” in my code the sequence in the Repair Manual.

As you can see in the slowmo video it is almost spot on!

It took me a while to figure out the flash but in the end it is really really simple. I just have to connect F+ to 6v from the camera, F-to GND, and then send a straight control signal from the Atmega to FF. The FT pin I don’t know it’s use.

In the opensx70 camera there are two ways of hooking a flash or studio light to the camera, directly to the flash edge connector or through the built in jack on the dongle (thus keeping the Dongle in place,  Here you will have the option to engage or not solenoid #2, and maybe a slower shutter speed. I have also tested this a seem to work as well:

I was thinking also a PC-flash option for 1/30 and another for 1/60, but I don’t know if this is going to be necessary, maybe just for f.8. I could understand that sometimes you might want the shutter to open at smaller apertures as in normal SX70 photography and sometimes you want full f.8 no matter what.

Of the two-position switches one would be to choose between double/multiple exposure or normal operation and the other switch I have no idea and am open for suggestions.

I have implemented a 10 seconds timer delay by keeping the button pressed for a while. So there’s no need to use a switch for that.
