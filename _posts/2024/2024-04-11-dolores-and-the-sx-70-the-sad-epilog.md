She married her high school sweetheart, Harold Pitts Harrower, and they had three children. They moved to Milford CT in 1961, where they raised their family and she began her career as a model and later a teacher for Hanover Modeling agency. Hanover Modeling Agency lead to her position with Polaroid Corporation.
