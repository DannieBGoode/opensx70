In 2021 I made a [post](https://opensx70.com/posts/2021/02/loli) about a [16mm reel I have found on Ebay](https://vimeo.com/477548753/97e0340cfb).

If you have not seen that film you should first see it in all its glory.

Immediately we were all asking ourselves who is that girl on the film?

W﻿ell in Saturday May 13th Doc SX70, Zane and me rented a convertible BMW and drove all the way to Conneticut to meet Dolores.

T﻿he trip took us longer than expected and we arrived a bit late, but all was good. Dolores and her daughter Sara had arranged a nice meal at the place she lives now.

W﻿e even had personalized names on the table.

M﻿eeting Dolores, was both an honor and a privilege. She is a kind educated person always with a smile on her face, smart and sharp as a tack, at 90 plus years old she still remembers everything.

S﻿he is both, beautiful and elegant. We also me with Sarah, Dolores daughter and her grandaughter. It was an absolut delight to meet these lady and feel tremendously grateful for all the effort they made to make this possible.

D﻿olores was very graceful with us, and let me take a good look at his albums of mementos.

F﻿rom there, it is possible to have a very good idea of her role in the rollout of the SX-70. Indeed, she was the face of the camera, and had a mission to spread the news about the product. To create news, and newspaper articles, to basically generate awareness about the camera. The 16mm film was part of that effort, indeed, as we all know, the camera was so new, so innovative that didn't fit any of the existing categories. Dolores mission, that she took, and carried to the end with grace, was to create awareness on SX-70 camera and the new, as revolutionary as the camera, new film: absolute instant photography.

S﻿he was the prototype of the "Polaroid Camera girl"

T﻿hen we spent the evening in Dolores fabulous apartment with her family, sharing memories and stories, a lifetime full of mementos in that house.

I﻿ find her vitality, a lesson to all of us, she told me that she would probably be travelling the world if not for her eyesight impediment.
