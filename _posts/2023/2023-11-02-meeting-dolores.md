In 2021 I made a [post](https://opensx70.com/posts/2021/02/loli) about a [16mm reel I have found on Ebay](https://vimeo.com/477548753/97e0340cfb).

If you have not seen that film you should first see it in all its glory.

Immediately we were all asking ourselves who is that girl on the film?

W﻿ell in Saturday May 13th Doc SX70, Zane and me rented a convertible BMW and drove all the way to Conneticut to meet Dolores.

T﻿he trip took us longer than expected and we arrived a bit late, but all was good. Dolores and her daughter Sara had arranged a nice meal at the place she lives now.

W﻿e even had personalized names on the table.

M﻿eeting Dolores, was both an honor and a privilege. She is a kind educated person always with a smile on her face, beatiful and sharp as a tack, at 90 plus years old she still remembers everything.
