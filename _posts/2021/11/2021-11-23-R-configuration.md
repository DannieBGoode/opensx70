#### 				FIGURE 1.


You might remember it, it was the biggest story from April 2010, a kid, Brian Hogan had found an iPhone4 in a bar in Redwood City California. 
Problem is the iPhone4 didn't yet exist as such yet: it was a prototype.



Brian said he called Apple trying to report the phone, true or not, the fact is that he sold the phone to [Gizmodo](https://www.gizmodo.com/) for 5000 dollars.


Now let's look back to September 8th 1975. (You can see the original bullentin at the end)

> **PRODUCT ALERT**
> 
> **FROM:** Ted Liszewski
> 
> **TO**: All Center Services Managers
> 
> **SUBJECT:** SX-70 SHUTTERS, R CONFIGURATION
> 
> *If a customer returns an SX-70 camera which has a shutter marked with an R configuration label, do the following to be sure it is, in fact, an R configuration shutter:*
> 
> 
>1.	*Check to see if it has a solenoid 2 assembly, If it does, it is not an R configuration shutter.*
> 2.	*If it doesn't have a solenoid 2 assembly, observe the blade opening. An R configuration shutter has blades that look like part A of Figure 1, while other shutter blades lock like part B of Figure 1.*
3.	*If the R shutter is not confirmed by steps 1 & 2, the shutter configuration was marked wrong.*
4.	*Then,determine if the shutter is hybrid or non-hybrid by using the bright light test with a flashbar inserted. Under a bright light the flash will not fire if the shutter is hybrid and will fire if the shutter is non-hybrid.*
5.	*Use appropriate test specifications for the shutter*

> <span style="background:yellow">If it is found to be an R shutter, good or bad, replace it with a Q shutter.</span>
> 
> <span style="background:yellow">Record the **customer's name, address and telephone number** and forward this information to me along with the shutter.</span>
> 
> *Specifications for the R shutter differ from all other SX-70 shutters.*

But I've already shown you how the [shutter](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/11/sx70-shutter) works. The inefficient shutter, as was called, had a changing aperture, and was the work of the late Dr.Baker and [Dr. Plummer](https://www.wtpoptics.com/about.html). It has the characteristic teardrop shape in one way or another...

So the question is: what is this "R configuration" and why do they want the R configuration shutters back so badly?

Aside from asking Ted Liszewski we can only speculate, but I think they must be lost prototypes, probably given to employees.

So here's my plea, if you have any information about the R Configuration or have a camera with that configuration, please contact me. Also, any related documentation would be very welcome.

Here's the original document:
