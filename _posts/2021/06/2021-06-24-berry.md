This is an article from a 1975 issue of Harper's Bazaar, and it can be considered sexist for a myriad of reasons, but please keep in mind it’s age.

I have not seen an online version, so I assume there’s really not much interest in it beyond our scope here. If this is infringing someone's copyright please notify me and I shall remove it at once.

So the first thing that attracted me to the article was the uses she pretends to have for the camera, more like a tool, and this is much in line with the [Eames film](https://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/sx-70-polaroid/). (Oh, and by the way, Charles and Ray Eames did not do the industrial design of the SX70, but more in a future post) But for me is in a sense the use we have now for our mobile devices, which is a camera as a record of something, as a tool . That is a key difference as to a “recreational” use.

But then I got curious.

Who is the girl in this (probably sponsored by Polaroid) “article”?
 
Well, it is [Berry Berenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_Berenson), the granddaughter of [Elsa Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli).

According to [www.famousphotographers.net](https://www.famousphotographers.net/berry-berenson):

*Berry’s sister [Marisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Berenson) was a popular model of that time. During this time, Berry Berenson fascinated the columnists of the society and editors of fashion, with her work.  Diana Vreeland was an editor at Vogue who knew the sisters from a young age and used to call them Berengaria and Mauretania, after the ocean liners of Cunard. Even editors of Harper’s Bazaar commissioned Berry to do fashion photography for them.*

*In 1973, Berenson married Anthony Perkins, her co-star in one of the movies. They married in Massachusetts’s Cape Cod. Berry and Perkins had two children, both were sons. Oz Perkins is a musician and actor, and Elvis Perkins is a rock artist. In 1992, Perkins died from complications related to AIDS.*

Berry was on [American Airlines flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11), when the aircraft crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center 9/11 2001 at 08:46:40 EST.

Here’s the transcribed article:

The SX-70 is the latest of Polaroid’s truly remarkable contributions to photography for fun. But it also has its practical uses, which makes it indispensable to the working woman. So we asked advice from one working woman, Berry Berenson (pictured below). This clever young photographer, who says she is never without her SX-70 helped us make some surprising suggestions.


 - **IF YOU ARE AN ANTIQUES BUFF**, take photos of pieces you’re considering buying to show your busy husband.

 - **ON HOLIDAY** in Venice, for instance, find out whether you have captured the incomparable light of a sunset. If not, reshoot on the spot and check the results instead of waiting to discover that you really didn’t get the quality of time and place.

 - **FOR INTERIOR DECORATING**, whether professionally or for your own home, always carry pictures of the rooms you’re trying to complete. Then anytime you have a minute to shop, you’ll be sure of the room’s proportions. Photos are also better than words to describe problem windows and impossible nooks.

 - **AT A CHILDREN’S BIRTHDAY PARTY**, make the taking of the pictures and watching them emerge almost magically from the camera a delightful part of the festivities.

 - **IF YOU TEACH**, record in a scrapbook the weekly progress of plant projects. Or take the camera on trips so that you can bring back visual reminders for class discussion.

 - **AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY** for adults, have decorative frames ready—in tortoise or fabric— and slip in photos of the guests to give as parting presents.

 - **IF YOU ARE AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER**, use the SX-70 to keep photo notes for accident reports or property damage. 
 
 - ** IF YOU RUN A SHOPPING SERVICE,** send photos to clients for their okays on merchandise you’ve selected.

 - **GET INSTANT SPORTS LESSONS**, when videotape is not available, for tennis or golf. Have a friend take photos of you at various stages of each stroke. The same principle applies to golf swings.

 - **FOR BUSINESS TRIPS**, take along a photo of your best haircut. Your hairdresser-on-location will instantly know exactly what style you want. 

 - **WHEN APARTMENT WALLS** need replastering, back up a letter to your landlord with a photo of spots needing repair. 

 - **INCOMING MAIL PACKAGES**, when damaged, should be photographed before opening so that you or your company will have proof that they arrived in poor condition.

 - **RECORD INSURED VALUABLES** on Polaroid film. In case of burglary, it will expedite explanations to your insurance company.

 - **LESSONS LAST LONGER** in your head when you photograph them. You’ll also have a record of how to do it, whether it’s flower arranging or Chinese cooking.
