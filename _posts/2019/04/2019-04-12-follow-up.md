So I have been building these reworked pcbs to test the light sensors and (finally!) do a working auto setting for the openSX70 cameras.
I have to admit that this is not the kind of work that I like to do or that I am good for that matter.


I have to build the boards from scratch, soldering all those smd components. And half way there I have to “improvise” so to speak, to accommodate for the new parts.
So first on soldering, the trick is using [flux AMTECH NC-559-ASM-TF](https://www.amazon.com/AMTECH-NC-559-ASM-TF-No-clean-solder-dispensing/dp/B078W4HBW5/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_2?crid=3ICBACTZSXYQX&keywords=amtech+nc-559-v2-tf&qid=1555233896&s=gateway&sprefix=NC-559%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-2-fkmrnull), no really, makes all much easier and the final product much much nicer, of course you have to clean after all the residue. I use a rather large tip, even for the Atmega328p, and it ends up not only being nicer, but also it is faster than soldering every single pin separately.

For rework I use fiberglass eraser when I need to remove the soldermask to connect to a track and a X-acto knife to cut the tracks.

So here’s my “cheatsheet” to install the [TSL235](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Imaging/TSL235R-LF.pdf).

Now I want to try different sensors like the TSL237,which is 2x more sensitive, different form factor chips, and even the TCS3200D, which is also a light to frequency device, but that has a small array of photodiodes and can be sensible to RGB.

Here's the TSL235 in its DIL form factor, it has a small lens. I wonder how the 2x factor on frequency and the lack of the lens and smaller size affects the magic number. We will see.

The [TSL237T](https://ams.com/documents/20143/36005/TSL237T_DS000129_3-00.pdf/4132e614-9e41-50fd-7d6e-0e65f18426e6) instead is much smaller and lacks the lens.

Finally a picture of the bigger [TCS3200D](https://www.mouser.es/datasheet/2/588/TCS3200-E11-1214807.pdf).
