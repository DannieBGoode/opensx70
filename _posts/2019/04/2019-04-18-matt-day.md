I have been an admirer of [Matt Day](http://www.mattdayphoto.com/) for a while, so I asked him if he wanted to test an openSX70 camera. He was super nice, and inmediately said yes.

I am really thankful of the video he made. Also I totally agree that an ["AUTO" mode for both ISO600 and ISO125](https://opensx70.com/posts/2019/04/autoexposure) is necessary.

I can reveal that there are at this moment two cameras with the [TSL235 light sensor](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/323585.pdf) in operation, one of course it's my Prototype X, and the other is in a secret location in the US.

The camera I sent to Matt is nevertheless Prototype 3.5, which is a manual-only prototype. It has already been tested by [Thomas Zamolo](https://opensx70.com/posts/2019/02/thomaszamolo) and my intention is to keep it rolling within the United States.
