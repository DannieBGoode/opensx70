In the beginning it was all about manual. Making the marvelous SX70 work with manual shutter speeds.

And we have accomplished that, and then some, double exposures, the firsts with no mechanical modification to do full F.8 flash with studio strobes, self timer... really really cool stuff.

So maybe many of you wonder why getting "auto" was so important to me. Or why, it is important in general: personally I love to shoot manual, usually use my iPhone as a light meter, and I love it, but it is true that are many many situation where you just want to take the shot, and probably a well calibrated camera will take a better shot that you due the circunstamces. But the answer is much simpler paraphrasing JFK: Why climb the highest mountain? 

So I have been [struggling](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/09/lightmeter-struggle) with it from the beginning, the first sensor I chose the BH1750, is one of the modern crop of sensor, the don't give a voltage or a current not even a frequency, they just say the value in lux. That meant problems for me from the get go, the values, after al the stuff in the camara (dark/light assembly) was too low and inexact, and it was damned slow.

So at one moment in time I decided to [go back to basics and chose a photodiode](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/10/photodiode), which for it characterisctics is very similar to the sensor (that is also a photodiode, in the original circuit).
The [photodiode](https://www.google.com/search?q=photodiode&oq=photodiode&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j35i39l2j0.2271j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) is a semiconductor that converts light into an electrical current, much like a solar panel. Turns out that using the photodiode as a lightmeter is not as simple as I thought (it never is actually).

This is when, Dave Walker, one of [the beta-testers](https://opensx70.com/posts/2019/02/meet-the-beta-testers), a electronics design engineer nowadays working as an R&D manager told me truth: my design was never going to work: in practice I "read" part of the spectrum, but the limits on the atmega328p analog-to-digital made it impossible to cover the whole range, say from EV6 to EV17 or something like that.
Fortunately he knows *A LOT* and provided a few ideas, and much needed help. 

One of the ideas of Dave was to turn light into frequency: the more light, the faster the frequency.
