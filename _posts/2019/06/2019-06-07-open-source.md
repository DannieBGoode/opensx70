Here's my humble take about open source. Keep in mind that it's just my opinion.

For me openSX70 it's been always an open source project: In the beginning I was trying to kickstart an elusive collaboration, later I just wanted to share in a "show and tell" sort of way.

There are [three pillars of open source](https://opensource.com/principles): transparency, participation and collaboration.

I think we can all agree that transparency has been accomplished, I have share all my failures and struggles.

Second participation. We got that too: many folks have commented and shared opinions. Amazing. Thank you.

Collaboration: that is definititely what I am struggling with: first of all, most people interested in the project are photographers. Stop. They don't have the skills to help. And when I have pressed for "photographic" technical questions, they shy away. 

Of course there are notable exceptions. Other times people want to help, but for whatever reason they don't have the time.

But every little helps. Help is not only pointing to me that my circuit lacks a bunch of capacitors (thank you Dave!). I remember I borrowed the camera to a photographer. He took flash pictures, he made a video. Really nice, and I appreciate. He didn't say anything or comment anything about the camera. But watching the video I could see that he was struggling, he was somehow "working against the camera".

Let me explain I came up with this feature of having a self-timer built in the camera. If you pressed the red button for a short period it would take a picture, but if you did a *long press* you ended up with a flashing led and a 10 seconds delay. Cool isn't it?

Well, not quite, the original camera just takes the picture if you do a long press, so many people *expected* the openSX70 camera to do that. AND THEY WHERE RIGHT.

So I fixed that. Now you have to do a quick double press to do the self timer. Otherwise I pretend to operate as the original camera.

And this is is the gist of the open-source thing, improving based on a collective experience: it is also a state of mind, it not a chinese obscure microcontroller, it is your will to share and improve.

But there's also that "other" thing of course. On the one side I know that there is no rocket-science, that almost anyone can rip-off the idea, even if I didn't share the files. Really, they copy much more complex stuff. There is no really interest, no volume.

But many people meassure success in dollars. I tried to protect myself against the obvious (someone manufacturing and selling my stuff) by using [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)

But this has always been always a second thought, for me its been about the SX70, and the process to figure out how it all works. Maybe going back to the sources. 

On the other hand I feel that many people want to test, to have a camera, and I think this has to be done right.

People wanted to build their own pcbs I keep saying what I have always said: it is not ready, it is still experimental crap. Don't even think about. If you are in Barcelona, you can come and pick up a set of blank pcbs. **I DON'T INTEND TO GIVE SUPPORT** to anyone trying to replicate what I do. Don't even ask what to do: I have enough to do with the web updates, designing the PCBs and improving the software.

I also want to say, as I always have said, no matter what, that I admire other commercial products that are basically considered the *gold standard*: I don't like to be compared, it is not fair. But that being said, I now feel confident enough to consider openSX70 moving towards being the new standard.
