I am off topic, but I wanted to share how I store and display my pictures.

  # Display photos

The awesome artisans at [Branca Ebenistes](https://www.facebook.com/BrancaEbenistes/] have made for me this shelves to display pictures.
It install in such a clever way that no screws are to be seen. It is around one meter wide and has a slot at 3º. Thre results are incredible, one is laquered white and the other is wood.
Thank you Jaume.

Of course I also use the ingenious [PolaStand](https://www.polastand.com/) that was gifted to me. Please check [my post about it](https://opensx70.com/posts/2018/10/polastand).

  # The camera

I saw on the internet a picture of a block of wood with a 16 degrees slope holding a camera. I was massive, and, in my opinion, it was awesome.

So again Jaume at [Branca Ebenistes](https://www.instagram.com/brancaebenistes/) made me one. It is one piece of wood.

  # Storage

First of all check [Marco's video about storing Polaroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFa6QwMdzqM). I think he has some great ideas.
  
Ever since early 2017 I take at least one SX70 picture that I store. This came as a challenge on how to do it properly and systematially.

I ended up using binders, [nothing speciall about them](https://www.amazon.es/Exacompta-51844E-Carpeta-anillas-mixtas/dp/B000KTCJ5A/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1553791273&sr=8-3&keywords=Carpetas+Anillas&refinements=p_89%3AExacompta). 
Here in the EU they are A4. I like these because you can somehow customize them. But the key part are those (no shit) beer-mat holder sheets.
I buy them bulk from a local manufacturer so it makes not much sense to list the brand. In any case I think they might not be made with the "proper" kind of plastic.
So I expect them to be melting sometime in the future. I found better (as museum grade plastic or something) but the pictures don't fit.

Having said that I admit that the Impossible project SX70 binders were the best. Unfortunately they no longer make them.

Then for bulk storage I use the wood case that come with (really) nice wine bottles

So this is it so far, if I come up with some other way to this I will update this post.
