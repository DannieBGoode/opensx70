Among the amazing people I have met through the openSX70 project I want to single out Santi. He is the person behind [AnalogueWorks](http://analogueworks.wixsite.com/analogueworks/copia-de-instant-film-type-100).

He makes these amazing over-engineered pinhole cameras.

His designs are not only beautiful, but really nicely constructed and thought out. Please check [his website](http://analogueworks.wixsite.com/analogueworks/copia-de-instant-film-type-100).

He has also been a faithful supporter of the openSX70 project. So we started talking... and talking... I was really happy when he told me he was thinking on designing a dongle for the project. What a treat.

I never cease to amaze at the ideas people bring to project. All sorts of ideas...

So when he told me he had something to show me... I was really happy.

So here you have them, even though it is a first draft, I really really like the design, and the ideas that he brings to project. 
Our approach here is to make the design from outside, so I will try to fit the electronics once the design is more or less settled.

Please remember that I consider the project dongle-agnostic. We welcome all sorts of designs and open ideas. There is no "one" dongle, but, starting with the uDongle I hope that there are many...
