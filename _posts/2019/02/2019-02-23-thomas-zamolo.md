The photographer [Thomas Zamolo](https://www.thomaszamolo.com/), has been kind enough to test the Prototype #3.5 openSX70 camera with studio flash. He has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmqfNXN54vuhl8Ns0yXtItw).

From the beginning the openSX70 project had a external flash 3.5mm jack. I have been testing it with strobes, but a "proper" with studio lights had eluded me.

First I tried flash with the electronic flashbar.

Next with a external flash, but with the camera compensating when too close.

Finally tested full F.8. I expected the picture to be like this.

I was worried because my tests were rather rudimentary and, he had quite an old version of the openSX70 software. But was hopeful.

The openSX70 dongle has been the first with a built-in 3.5mm jack for an external flash or studio lights, that you can easily use at full f.8 or as a regular flashbar without software modification.

Thank you Thomas. Amazing work you do. Love your mosaic compositions!
